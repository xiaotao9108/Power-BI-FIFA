This project consists of three comprehensive dashboards analyzing FIFA players' data from 2015.

## League Dashboard
This dashboard provides an overview of FIFA 2015, featuring data on the number of clubs, leagues, and countries, along with insights into median potential, wage, and value across leagues. The analysis reveals that among the 149 countries, 37 leagues, 577 clubs, and approximately 15,920 players, the Ukrainian Premier League emerged as the top-performing league with the highest potential, value, and wage.

* Key Tools Used: Cards, tables.



## Physical Dashboard
This dashboard explores the relationships between player positions, physical attributes (age, height, and weight), and potential across leagues and clubs. Notably, the CF (Center Forward) position exhibits the highest overall score and potential.

* Key Tools Used: Tables, cards, scatter plots, and slicers.

## Performance Dashboard
A drill-down dashboard focusing on individual player skills, such as defending and passing. Users can navigate through five buttons named after key technique categories (e.g., "Attack"), which display pie charts showcasing their sub-skills, such as volleys, crossing, short passing, heading accuracy, and finishing.

Interactive Features:
* A pie chart for visualizing key performance metrics.
* A dropdown list to filter by leagues and clubs.
* A comparison table on the right to benchmark the selected club's performance against the top N (up to 10) clubs.
These features help users evaluate and compare football skills effectively, enabling data-driven decision-making for player positioning and performance analysis.
